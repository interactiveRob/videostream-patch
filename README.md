# Videostream Patch (Unofficial)
A Chrome Extension made to patch broken Videostream Casting in newer versions of Chrome.

<br/>

### Unofficial Patch. This extension works, but was NOT developed by the Videostream team. 

<br/>

## How to use:
Install this extension if you aren't seeing a list of cast devices when you click on the Cast button in Videostream. 

### Install the extension
- Download the latest zip of the extension here from [the Releases Page](https://github.com/interactiveRob/videostream-patch/releases)
- Unzip the downloaded zip archive
- Open the Extension Management page by navigating to `chrome://extensions`.
- Alternatively, open this page by clicking on the Extensions menu button and selecting Manage Extensions at the bottom of the menu.
- Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.
- Click the Load unpacked button and select the extension directory.

### Reload Videostream
- Once installed, close and re-open Videostream. Casting should now work!
